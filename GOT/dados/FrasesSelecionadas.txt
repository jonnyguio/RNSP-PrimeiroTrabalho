They set forth at daybreak to see a man beheaded , twenty in all , and Bran rode among them , nervous with excitement .
This was the first time he had been deemed old enough to go with his lord father and his brothers to see the king 's justice done .
Robb thought he was a wildling , his sword sworn to Mance Rayder , the King beyond-the-Wall .
The wildlings were cruel men , she said , slavers and slayers and thieves .
Finally his lord father gave a command , and two of his guardsmen dragged the ragged man to the ironwood stump in the center of the square .
Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword .
`` Ice , '' that sword was called .
He took hold of Ice with both hands and said , `` In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon , the First of his Name , King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men , Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm , by the word of Eddard of the House Stark , Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North , I do sentence you to die . ''
He lifted the greatsword high above his head .
His father took off the man 's head with a single sure stroke .
The head bounced off a thick root and rolled .
It came up near Greyjoy 's feet .
Theon was a lean , dark youth of nineteen who found everything amusing .
He laughed , put his boot on the head , and kicked it away .
It seemed colder on the long ride back to Winterfell , though the wind had died by then and the sun was higher in the sky .
Bran rode with his brothers , well ahead of the main party , his pony struggling hard to keep up with their horses .
He was of an age with Robb , but they did not look alike .
Jon was slender where Robb was muscular , dark where Robb was fair , graceful and quick where his half brother was strong and fast .
So deep in thought was he that he never heard the rest of the party until his father moved up to ride beside him .
`` Are you well , Bran ? ''
he asked , not unkindly .
`` Yes , Father , '' Bran told him .
`` Robb says the man died bravely , but Jon says he was afraid . ''
`` What do you think ? ''
his father asked .
Bran thought about it .
`` Can a man still be brave if he 's afraid ? ''
`` That is the only time a man can be brave , '' his father told him .
In truth , the man was an oathbreaker , a deserter from the Night 's Watch .
The question was not why the man had to die , but why I must do it . ''
Yet our way is the older way .
The blood of the First Men still flows in the veins of the Starks , and we hold to the belief that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword .
`` One day , Bran , you will be Robb 's bannerman , holding a keep of your own for your brother and your king , and justice will fall to you .
When that day comes , you must take no pleasure in the task , but neither must you look away .
A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is . ''
That was when Jon reappeared on the crest of the hill before them .
`` Father , Bran , come quickly , see what Robb has found ! ''
Jory Cassel and Theon Greyjoy were the first to reach the boys .
`` What in the seven hells is it ? ''
Greyjoy was saying .
`` A wolf , '' Robb told him .
`` A freak , '' Greyjoy said .
`` Look at the size of it . ''
`` It 's no freak , '' Jon said calmly .
`` That 's a direwolf .
They grow larger than the other kind . ''
Theon Greyjoy said , `` There 's not been a direwolf sighted south of the Wall in two hundred years . ''
Bran tore his eyes away from the monster .
That was when he noticed the bundle in Robb 's arms .
The pup was a tiny ball of grey-black fur , its eyes still closed .
`` Do we know what killed her ? ''
`` There 's something in the throat , '' Robb told him , proud to have found the answer before his father even asked .
A foot of shattered antler , tines snapped off , all wet with blood .
`` I 'm surprised she lived long enough to whelp , '' he said .
`` Born with the dead , '' another man put in .
`` No matter , '' said Hullen .
`` They be dead soon enough too . ''
`` The sooner the better , '' Theon Greyjoy agreed .
He drew his sword .
`` Give the beast here , Bran . ''
`` Put away your sword , Greyjoy , '' Robb said .
For a moment he sounded as commanding as their father , like the lord he would someday be .
`` We will keep these pups . ''
`` Lord Stark , '' Jon said .
Bran looked at him with desperate hope .
`` There are five pups , '' he told Father .
`` You have five trueborn children , '' Jon said .
The direwolf is the sigil of your House .
Your children were meant to have these pups , my lord . ''
The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself .
He had included the girls , included even Rickon , the baby , but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow , the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own .
`` Easy to say , and harder to do .
If you want these pups , you will feed them yourselves .
`` You must train them as well , '' their father said .
`` The pups may die anyway , despite all you do . ''
`` They wo n't die , '' Robb said .
`` Keep them , then .
Jory , Desmond , gather up the other pups .
It 's time we were back to Winterfell . ''
Halfway across the bridge , Jon pulled up suddenly .
`` What is it , Jon ? ''
their lord father asked .
`` Ca n't you hear it ? ''
`` There , '' Jon said .
He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge .
A moment later he was riding back to them , smiling .
`` He must have crawled away from the others , '' Jon said .
`` Or been driven away , '' their father said , looking at the sixth pup .
His fur was white , where the rest of the litter was grey .
`` An albino , '' Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement .
`` This one will die even faster than the others . ''
Jon Snow gave his father 's ward a long , chilling look .
`` I think not , Greyjoy , '' he said .
`` This one belongs to me . ''
Catelyn had never liked this godswood .
She had been born a Tully , at Riverrun far to the south , on the Red Fork of the Trident .
The gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood .
This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green needles , of mighty oaks , of ironwoods as old as the realm itself .
But she knew she would find her husband here tonight .
Whenever he took a man 's life , afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood .
The Tullys kept a godswood , as all the great houses did , but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun .
Worship was for the sept. For her sake , Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god , but the blood of the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks , and his own gods were the old ones , the nameless , faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest .
At the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold .
A face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree , its features long and melancholy , the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful .
It was said that the children of the forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the First Men across the narrow sea .
Catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood , seated on a moss-covered stone .
`` Arya is already in love , and Sansa is charmed and gracious , but Rickon is not quite sure . ''
And winter is coming . ''
The words gave her a chill , as they always did .
`` Ben writes that the strength of the Night 's Watch is down below a thousand .
The day may come when I will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this Kingbeyond-the-Wall for good and all . ''
`` Until this morning , no living man had ever seen a direwolf either , '' Catelyn reminded him .
`` There was grievous news today , my lord .
Jon Arryn is dead . ''
In his youth , Ned had fostered at the Eyrie , and the childless Lord Arryn had become a second father to him and his fellow ward , Robert Baratheon .
When the Mad King Aerys Targaryen had demanded their heads , the Lord of the Eyrie had raised his moon-and-falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had pledged to protect .
`` And Jon 's boy .
What word of them ? ''
The message said only that they were well , and had returned to the Eyrie , '' Catelyn said .
`` Take the children .
Fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter .
That boy of hers needs other children about him , and Lysa should not be alone in her grief . ''
The king is riding to Winterfell to seek you out . ''
It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words , but when the understanding came , the darkness left his eyes .
a direwolf dead in the snow , a broken antler in its throat .
`` We should send word to your brother on the Wall . ''
How many in his party , did the message say ? ''
`` I should think a hundred knights , at the least , with all their retainers , and half again as many freeriders .
Cersei and the children travel with them . ''
There was small love between him and the queen 's family , Catelyn knew .
The Lannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Robert 's cause , when victory was all but certain , and he had never forgiven them .
The Lannister woman is our queen , and her pride is said to grow with every passing year . ''
`` There must be a feast , of course , with singers , and Robert will want to hunt .
I shall send Jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back .
